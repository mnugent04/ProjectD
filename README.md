## Misleading strategies
Cherry picking data points that best supported my claims.

Time graph only spanning two, not so recent years so that my claim could be 'proved'.

Not explicitly showing the years of the data I was using, or making it small and not grab your attention.

Changing y-axis to make the slope more extreme than it truly is.
